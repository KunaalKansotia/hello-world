# hello-world
A beginning to development
I graduated in 2015 USICT(GGSIPU) as a Computer Science Engineer. 
I always thought coding was not for me and hence chose a career path in the Operations domain.
I am working for Airbnb and will complete 5yrs on 2nd Nov 2023 and will gain an overall experience of around 6.5-7 yrs.
But still I always had that regret in me I did not try coding.
To not regret forever in life I have started my Coding Journey.
I am always curious to see so many beautiful websites and how they work. 
Hence, I would love become a Full Stack Web Developer
Hope to get there soon. ðŸ˜Š
